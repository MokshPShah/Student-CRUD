# Student Project

**Student Registration** is a lightweight React single-page application initialized with Vite. The repository includes a minimal configuration that enables hot module replacement, ESLint rules, and a simple data storage mechanism using a `db.json` file.

## Features

- React + Vite starter setup
- ESLint configured for JavaScript development
- Two core components: `Form` for submitting data and `ViewData` for displaying stored records
- Static assets served from the `public` directory
- Simple JSON-backed data persistence (`db.json`)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run development server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`

This project serves as a foundation for exploring form handling and data presentation in React.
